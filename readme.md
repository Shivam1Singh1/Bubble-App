# Arrow Hit Game

This project is a simple HTML5 Canvas-based game.  
A moving arrow attempts to hit a circle on the screen. When the arrow successfully hits the circle, the circle changes its color.  
If the arrow misses and crosses the boundary, it resets to its original position. A manual reset option is also available.



## Features
1. Full-screen responsive layout without scrolling.  
2. Circle changes color when hit.  
3. Arrow moves smoothly with proper collision detection.  
4. "Hit" button to launch the arrow.  
5. "Reset" button to restart the game at any time.
